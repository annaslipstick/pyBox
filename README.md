PyBox — The Anarchist's Python VM Manager

Forget your bloated, corporate-grade hypervisors. PyBox is the raw, unfiltered gateway to unleashing Python-powered virtual realms. No flashy GUIs, no internet dependency, just pure, unapologetic control over your custom-made Python OS “ISOs” — sandboxed, isolated, and ready to bend reality on your command.

PyBox doesn’t ask for your permission. It executes. It manages. It launches your wildest Python dystopias. From stripped-down kernels to bespoke desktop environments, your imagination is the only limit. Build your own kingdom of code, your virtual empire where you reign supreme.

No bloatware. No bullshit. Just Python, power, and anarchy.
